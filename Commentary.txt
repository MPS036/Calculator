This is one of my very first projects that I did during self-study.

The calculator performs basic functions, but I found one bug. I couldn't fix it and left it.
Yes, this is not the right approach, but I wanted to move on to the following projects,
which are also presented in this repository.

The bug is that after receiving the response, the user can continue writing in QLineEdit.
For a better understanding, I will give an example:
6*8=48 and after pressing any number (for example 9) the LineEdit window would be transformed into 489.
